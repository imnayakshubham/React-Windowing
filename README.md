## Virtualizing Long Lists in React

This repository provides resources and examples for optimizing the performance of long lists in React using virtualization techniques.

### Introduction

When working with long lists of data in React, rendering all of the items at once can lead to performance issues and slow down the user experience. Virtualization is a technique that improves the efficiency of rendering long lists by only rendering the items that are currently visible on the screen.

There are several libraries and techniques available for virtualizing long lists in React, including React-window, React-virtualized, and others. This repository focuses on using the React-window library, which provides a lightweight and flexible solution for virtualizing long lists in React.

### Installation
To use the React-window library in your React application, you can install it using npm or yarn:

````
npm install react-window

or

yarn add react-window
````
